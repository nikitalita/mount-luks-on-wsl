# mount-luks-on-wsl
Provides scripts for building a custom kernel and mounting a luks drive on WSL

TODO: provide instructions, but basically just build the kernel with my config, then put the scripts in the same directory and run the batch file with a physical path to the drive (You can also run it with -? to see the instructions). Can only mount drives that are not used by Windows at the moment.
